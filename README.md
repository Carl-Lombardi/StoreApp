# Store App (Amazon Like CLI App) (Repo - https://github.com/Carl-Lombardi/StoreApp)
This is Store App, a CLI App which allows a user to purchase an item from a list of items provided and specify the amount requested. If the user chooses an amount within the amount in stock, the order is then placed. If the user chooses an amount above the amount in stock, the user is then provided with an error message and the user is logged out. After a successful purchase of a good, upon relogging into the app, it shows the amount of that item is stock is reduced. 

## Installation 
This is a CLI app which uses Javascript and requires the installation of mySQL, Inquistor and node.js

## How to Use
Upon installing the necessary programs, the user will then navigate to the folder where the StoreApp.js is located using CLI. After that, the app is opened with node StoreApp.js and the program begins. Once that step occurs, the app is very straightforward. 

## Screenshots
Please note as this is a CLI app, that there will be a folder of screenshots which  will show every single step of the operation. 

## Issues and Solutions
The biggest issue was making sure the code remained clean throughout the coding process.
